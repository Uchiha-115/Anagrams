<h1>History of Html</h1>

<p>HTML was first created in 1991 by a man known as Sir Tim Berners-Lee but he did not release it offically.
    This version of HTML only contained 18 tags when it was released.
    HTML 1.0 was then released in 1993 but at that time there were not many developers who were making websites
    as well that the language at the time was very limiting and not much could be done with it.
    HTML was then later published in 1995 now known as HTML 2.0. HTML 2.0 contained all the features that HTML 1.0 
    had as well as that it contained some new features. HTML 2.0 became the standard markup language used for creating 
    and desigining websites up until 1997. In 1997, a man called Dave Ragget introduced a fresh draft on HTML known as 
    HTML 3.0. This new version of HTML came with new and improved features which gave webmasters more powerful characteristics 
    when desigining webpages. However a drwaback of these new powerful features was that they resulted in the slowing down of 
    the browser which in turn prevented any further improvements being made. There was also a bit of trouble that arose at this time also 
    due to a company called Netscape. Netscape had become the leader in the browser market thanks to their browser called Netscape 
    Navigator. Webmasters at this time wanted new tags to further enchance their sites and so Netscape included new propierty tags and 
    attributes into the Netscape Navigator browser known as Netscape extension tags. This was the cause of problems for other browsers who 
    tried to replicate the effects of the extension tags, so as to not be left behind, as they were unable to get their own browsers to display 
    the tags the same way. This resulted in that any page that had been designed using the Netscape extension tags, then the page would look bad
    in other browsers. This caused much confusion and irritation among the early webmasters. HTML 3.2 was a toned down version of HTML 3.0 which 
    left out many of the big advances for future versions. it had been developed by W3C, an organisation founded in 1994 to standerise HTML and to make 
    sure that it was evolving in the right direction. Many of the extension tags that had been created by Netscape did not make it into this new standard 
    of HTML. HTML 4.0 was recommend in December 1997 by the W3C 
    and later on became the offical standard the next year in April 1998. After HTML 4.0 had been released for a short period, its documentation was 
    revised and a few small aspects were correted leading to HTML 4.01, the final iteration, which was released in 1999.
    It was then followed by HTML 5.0 which is used worldwide. It was published in 2012 and it can be said that Html 5.0 is an extended
    version of HTML 4.01. There are currently now 140 HTML tags however there are some that have become obseloute as they are not 
    supported by modern browsers.
